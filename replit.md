# CODE VIVEKS Landing Page

## Overview

CODE VIVEKS is a production-ready landing page for the premier coding club at Swami Vivekananda Institute of Technology (SVIT), Secunderabad. The application showcases club information, team structures, events, leadership, and provides a platform for prospective members to learn about and join the organization. Built with modern web technologies, it features a futuristic design with glass morphism effects, smooth animations, and full responsiveness.

## Recent Changes (November 2, 2025)

### Responsive Design Enhancements
- **Typography Scaling**: Implemented responsive typography across all sections using Tailwind breakpoints (text-3xl sm:text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl)
- **Adaptive Layouts**: All sections now use responsive padding (py-12 sm:py-16 md:py-20) and spacing for consistent mobile-to-desktop experience
- **Grid Responsiveness**: Grid layouts adapt seamlessly (grid sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3) for optimal content distribution
- **Mobile-First CTAs**: Buttons and call-to-action elements are full-width on mobile (w-full sm:w-auto) for better touch interaction
- **Component Optimization**: Hero, About, Leadership, Teams, Events, Join, Projects, and Contact sections fully responsive
- **Layout Refinements**: Index layout uses responsive padding (px-3 sm:px-4 md:px-6) with overflow-x-hidden to prevent horizontal scroll
- **Performance**: Maintained smooth animations and transitions across all device sizes

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **React 18 with TypeScript**: Component-based architecture using functional components with hooks
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server configured for optimal performance
- **SWC**: Super-fast TypeScript/JavaScript compiler for faster builds

### Styling Architecture
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework with custom design system
- **Design System**: Custom HSL color palette with CSS variables for theming
  - Dark mode as default with light mode support
  - Neumorphic design with glass morphism effects
  - Custom color scheme: Deep space backgrounds with neon cyan and green accents
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui components for consistent, accessible UI elements

- **Modular components**: Reusable UI components in `/components/ui` directory
- **Data-driven content**: Centralized content management in `/data/content.ts`

### State Management
- **React Context API**: ThemeContext for light/dark mode switching

### Performance Optimizations
- **Code splitting**: Dynamic imports and lazy loading where applicable
- **Memo optimization**: React.memo for expensive components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Image optimization**: Proper image formats and lazy loading strategy
- **CSS-in-JS avoidance**: Tailwind classes for better performance over runtime CSS

### Type Safety
- **TypeScript configuration**: Relaxed strictness for development flexibility
- **Component prop types**: Interface definitions for all major components
